## Load Libraries and Data

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(corrplot)
library(GGally)
library(gridExtra)

# Read in the dataset (Assuming CSV is in the working directory)
df <- read.csv("final_dataset.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Convert categorical variables to factors
df$Genre <- as.factor(df$Genre)
df$directors <- as.factor(df$directors)
df$writers <- as.factor(df$writers)
df$original_language <- as.factor(df$original_language)
df$status <- as.factor(df$status)
df$year_released <- as.numeric(df$year_released)

# Convert budget and revenue to numeric (remove commas if needed)
df$budget <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", df$budget))
df$revenue <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", df$revenue))
df$runtime <- as.numeric(df$runtime)
df$vote_average <- as.numeric(df$vote_average)
df$vote_count <- as.numeric(df$vote_count)
df$numVotes <- as.numeric(df$numVotes)
df$popularity <- as.numeric(df$popularity)
df$trailer_views <- as.numeric(df$trailer_views)
df$trailer_likes <- as.numeric(df$trailer_likes)

```

## Summary Stats

```{r}
# Basic summary statistics for numeric variables
summary_stats <- df %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_Budget = mean(budget, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_Budget = median(budget, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_Budget = sd(budget, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_Revenue = mean(revenue, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_Revenue = median(revenue, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_Revenue = sd(revenue, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_Runtime = mean(runtime, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_Vote_Average = mean(vote_average, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_Popularity = mean(popularity, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
print(summary_stats)

```

## Correlation Analysis

```{r}
# revenue focused
# Select random numerical variables to test (Not all)
correlation_matrix <- df %>%
  select(budget, revenue, runtime, vote_average, vote_count, popularity, trailer_views, trailer_likes, numVotes) %>%
  cor(use = "complete.obs")

# Visualize correlation matrix
corrplot(correlation_matrix, method = "color", type = "upper", tl.cex = 0.8)

```

## Distribution of Budget and Revenue

```{r}
# Histogram for Revenue
ggplot(df, aes(x = revenue)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_x_log10() + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Movie Revenue", x = "Revenue (log scale)", y = "Count")

# Histogram for Budget
ggplot(df, aes(x = budget)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = "red", alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_x_log10() + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Movie Budget", x = "Budget (log scale)", y = "Count")

```

## Boxplot: Budget vs. Revenue

```{r}

# way to many genre to show this

ggplot(df, aes(x = as.factor(Genre), y = revenue)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(title = "Revenue Distribution by Genre", x = "Genre", y = "Revenue (log scale)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

## Scatterplot: Budget vs. Revenue

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = budget, y = revenue)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") +
  scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() +
  labs(title = "Budget vs. Revenue", x = "Budget (log scale)", y = "Revenue (log scale)")

```

## Impact of Popularity on Revenue 

wont use popularity later as its not a pre-release stat but good to look at now

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = popularity, y = revenue)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "green") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Popularity vs. Revenue", x = "Popularity", y = "Revenue")

```

## Categorical Impact: Directors, Cast, Language

```{r}
# Revenue by Director (Top 10)
top_directors <- df %>%
  group_by(directors) %>%
  summarise(Mean_Revenue = mean(revenue, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Mean_Revenue)) %>%
  head(10)

ggplot(top_directors, aes(x = reorder(directors, Mean_Revenue), y = Mean_Revenue)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "purple") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Directors by Average Revenue", x = "Director", y = "Average Revenue")

# Revenue by Cast (Top 10)
top_cast <- df %>%
  group_by(actors) %>%
  summarise(Mean_Revenue = mean(revenue, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Mean_Revenue)) %>%
  head(10)

ggplot(top_cast, aes(x = reorder(actors, Mean_Revenue), y = Mean_Revenue)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "purple") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Actors by Average Revenue", x = "Cast", y = "Average Revenue")

# Revenue by Language (Top 10)
top_language <- df %>%
  group_by(original_language) %>%
  summarise(Mean_Revenue = mean(revenue, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Mean_Revenue)) %>%
  head(10)

ggplot(top_language, aes(x = reorder(original_language, Mean_Revenue), y = Mean_Revenue)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "purple") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Languages by Average Revenue", x = "Language", y = "Average Revenue")
```

## Time Series ??

need to fix good to look at

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = year_released, y = revenue)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Revenue Trends Over Time", x = "Year Released", y = "Revenue")

```
