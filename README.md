# Movie Revenue Web Application

## Objective ✔️

The main objectives are:
- Be able to make prediction on the revenue of movies that will be released in the next 5-6 months. 
- To experience on predicting box office revenue for movies using different approaches including sentiment analysis on user comments.
- To experience with API production and dashboard integration.

End Project: To deliver a web application supporting CRUD operation from data sources and can review revenue prediction results.

## Research Question:
- How do we hold sequel movie revenue accountable?
- How can we control the inflation rate if we want to use early movies? (Using the Consumer Price Index could be a solution.)
- How do we standardize movie revenue? (The revenue variable we have is probably gross revenue since the movie's release, we can try to classified movie revenue into categories to standardized it to certain extent)
- Using information from five years earlier might not be reliable. (We can probably solve this issue by including more covariates)
