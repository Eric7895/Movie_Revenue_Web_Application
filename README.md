# Movie Revenue Web Application

## Objective ✔️

The main objectives are:
- Be able to make prediction on the revenue of movies that will be released in the next 5-6 months. 
- To experience on predicting box office revenue for movies using different approaches including sentiment analysis on user comments.
- To experience with API production and dashboard integration.

End Project: To deliver a web application supporting CRUD operation from data sources and can review revenue prediction results.

## Research Question:
- How do we hold sequel movie revenue accountable?
- How can we control the inflation rate if we want to use early movies? (Using the Consumer Price Index could be a solution.)
- How do we standardize movie revenue? (The revenue variable we have is probably gross revenue since the movie's release.)
- Using information from five years earlier might not be reliable. (We can probably solve this issue by including more covariates.)
