# Movie Revenue Web Application

## Objective ✔️

The main objectives are:
- Be able to make prediction on the revenue of movies that will be released in the next 5-6 months. 
- To experience on predicting box office revenue for movies using different approaches including sentiment analysis on user comments.
- To experience with API production and dashboard integration.

End Project: To deliver a web application supporting CRUD operation from data sources and can review revenue prediction results.

## Research Question:
- How do we hold sequel movie revenue accountable?
- How to control inflation rate if we want to use early movies? (Using Consumer Price Index can be a solution)
- How do we standardized movie revenue? (The revenue variable we have are probably gross revenue since movie released)
- Using informations five year earlier might not be reliable (We can probably solve this question by including more covariate)
